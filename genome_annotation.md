## Gene Annotation and Structure
### Prokaryotic
Structure
- mRNA is often *polycistronic*: multiple coding regions in one piece of mRNA
- an *operon* is a cluster of genes that are controlled by the same promoter
- a transcription unit denotes any segment of DNA that codes for an RNA molecule
- - an operon can encompass multiple transcriptional units
### Eukaryotic
