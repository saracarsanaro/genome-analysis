## NGS Sequencing and Analysis: DNA

### SNPs
A polymorphism involves one of two or more variants of a particular DNA sequence, with some definitions requiring the least common allele to have a frequency of about 1% or greater. A SNP is a substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome. 

The functional consequences of a SNP include _coding_ - protein variation; _silent_ - doesn't impact protein coding but may impact splicing; _promoter or regulatory_ - may impact expression; and _other_ - no known impact, useful as a chromosomal marker. 

The three categories of SNPs are _synonymous_ - coding region, amino acid doesn't change; _non-synonymous_ - coding region, amino acid changes; and _noncoding_ - in a noncoding region.

A number of SNP databases exist. [dbSNP]() via NCBI is the largest database of SNPs, MNPs, and short indels. [SNPEffect]() focuses on predicting the impact of SNPs on the structural phenotype of proteins. [SNPedia]() is a wiki that collects information from publications on known SNPs and their clinical effects. The [1000 Genomes Browser]() and [Variation Viewer]() are good resources for visualizing SNPs. [ClinVar]() is a good resource for curated variations that have possible medical and clinical relevance.
