## NGS Sequencing and Analysis: DNA

### SNPs
A polymorphism involves one of two or more variants of a particular DNA sequence, with some definitions requiring the least common allele to have a frequency of about 1% or greater. A SNP is a substitution of a single nucleotide at a specific position in the genome. The functional consequences of a SNP include _coding_ - protein variation; _silent_ - doesn't impact protein coding but may impact splicing; _promoter or regulatory_ - may impact expression; and _other_ - no known impact, useful as a chromosomal marker. The three categories of SNPs are _synonymous_ - coding region, amino acid doesn't change; _non-synonymous_ - coding region, amino acid changes; and _noncoding_ - in a noncoding region.

A number of SNP databases exist.
